1. To adjust filters, look for the list of filters with the comment
    and make modifications, as follows:
    duration : can be upto past 5 years
    then_ factor: % of previous value
    drop : if true, it will check if present value is lower than past.
2. Types of marks are {open,close,high,low,volume}
3. for every filter, first mark is for present value, and second mark is for past value.
4. Options for agg are: {'max','min','avg'}
5. For notification, in the filters list, you can turn the option, notify = True or False.
6. For LiveMonitor, you can turn notify_all = True, so that you get notified only if all intraday filters are true,
    else, you get notifications for all filters.

7. For Compare filter, don't use agg option and date option at same time. It will give error.
